# harpoond

Provides basic support to control Corsair Harpoon Mouse's LEDs.
Being able to reliably turn off the mouse LED and set its color (static) is what you can expect.

It's not the goal of this project to offer all features present in iCUE, for that OpenRGB and ckb-next are more suited.
Bluetooth support is also out of scope.

> Attention: if you found this project it's very likely that you already own this mouse, if not don't buy it. If you still can return it do so.
>
> I admit this is not pricey mouse, but its quality is terrible considering the price point.
> The dongle is a joke, my 10-year-old logitech M305 is much more reliable.
> In less than one year double clicks (aka ghost clicks) started, I just didn't return it because I bought while abroad.
>
> Finally, the fact that it cannot persist settings and reset them after 60 seconds seems to be by design so users will have iCUE running all the time, which is either stupid or shady.

## How to build and use

### Linux

You need to have installed a C compiler and libsub, on Arch that's possible with `pacman -S gcc libusb`, while on Ubuntu/Debian `apt install gcc libusb-1.0-0-dev`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/andreldm/harpoond
cd harpoond
# Tweak values in harpoond.c, where it says "Set custom configuration"
make
sudo make install
systemctl --user enable --now harpoond.service
```

### Windows

While it's possible to build this project with Visual Studio, I recommend [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) because it's easier to get libusb to work and requires no code changes.

In a mingw64 shell, run:

```shell
pacman -S git make pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb
git clone https://github.com/andreldm/harpoond
cd harpoond
# Tweak values in harpoond.c, where it says "Set custom configuration"
make -f Makefile.msys2
# Press Win + R, execute shell:startup, create a shortcut to harpoon.exe in that folder
```

## Uninstall

### Linux

```shell
systemctl --user disable --now harpoond.service
sudo make uninstall
```

### Windows

Just remove the shortcut from the startup folder and delete the source folder.
